            <p>At the Global Alliance for Immune Prediction and Intervention (GLIMPRINT), we are dedicated to enhancing
                human health by developing and applying advanced computational models of the immune system. By bringing
                together experts in modeling, immunology, and medicine, we tackle the complex challenges of creating and
                using multi-scale immune models to combat a variety of diseases. Our collaborative efforts span
                industry, academia, and healthcare, working with international, federal, state, and private agencies to
                pioneer innovative approaches for large scale projects.</p>

            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Founding:</strong> We were founded in October 2020, early in the COVID pandemic, as the
                    Viral Pandemics Working Group (VPWG), part of the Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG) and
                    Multiscale modeling group (MSM). IMAG/MSM is a collaboration between multiple US research agencies
                    and the research community focused on the development of computational models relevant to human
                    health.</li>
                <li><strong>Initial Goals:</strong> The VPWG aimed to bring together, through a series on online
                    seminars and meetings, researchers across a wide range of medical, biological, scientific, and
                    computational domains to share expertise, ideas and approaches to responding to a global pandemic.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Evolution:</strong> In January of 2023, VPWG members founded the Global Alliance for Immune
                    Prediction and Intervention (GLIMPRINT) as a non-profit 501(c)(3) in the USA.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Predictive Immune Models:</strong> Develop and apply models to better understand systemic
                    immune-related etiologies and pathologies, ushering in a new era of precision medicine.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Create and implement the technological, scientific,
                    regulatory, and social frameworks essential for incorporating modeling into medicine.</li>
                <li><strong>Expertise Resource:</strong> Serve as the leading resource for academia, industry, and
                    governments in understanding the immune system to improve treatment of existing diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Pandemic Preparedness:</strong> Enhance readiness for future pandemics and emerging
                    diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Achievements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtual Seminar Series:</strong> Access over 165 recorded seminars on our <a

                        channel</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Forum on Precision Immunology:</strong> Brought together leading experts for a discussion on
                    the development and implementation of immune digital twins in medicine.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Immune Digital Twins Workshop:</strong> Fostered collaboration among
                    interdisciplinary researchers to advance immune digital twin technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Twin Innovation Hub:</strong> Developing a draft digital twin of the immune system
                    to characterize the multi-scale nature of immune system homeostasis.</li>
                <li><strong>Publications:</strong> Contributed over 35 peer-reviewed papers on immune response modeling
                    and disease processes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why GLIMPRINT?</h3>
